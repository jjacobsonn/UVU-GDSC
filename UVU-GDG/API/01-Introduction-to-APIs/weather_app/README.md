<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Weather Application is a beginner-friendly Python project designed to introduce new students to the basics of working with APIs. This project is particularly useful for those who are just starting out with Python and want to learn how to interact with web services.

## Why This Project?

In today's technology landscape, understanding how to work with APIs is a crucial skill for any software developer. APIs allow different software systems to communicate with each other, making it possible to integrate various services and create powerful applications. By working on this weather application, students will:

- **Learn the Basics of API Integration**: Understand how to make HTTP requests using Python and parse JSON responses.
- **Get Hands-On Experience**: Apply what they learn in a practical project that gives immediate, visible results.
- **Build a Foundation for More Complex Projects**: Gain the confidence to take on more challenging projects involving API integration.

### Built With

This project is built using:

* **Python**: The programming language used for the application logic.
* **Requests Library**: A Python library for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
* **OpenWeatherMap API**: The web service used to fetch real-time weather data.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

* **Python**:
```
    sh
    python --version
```

* **Requests Library**:
```
    pip install requests
```

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```
    git clone https://github.com/jjacobsonn/weather-app.git
```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```
cd Meeting-01-Introduction-to-APIs
```

3. **Install required packages**:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Set up your API key**:
- Sign up for an API key at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- Replace the placeholder API key in `weather_app.py` with your own.


### Usage

1. Run the Python Script:
```
    python weather_app.py
```
2. Enter the name of a city when prompted, and the application will display the current temperature in both Celsius and Fahrenheit, along with a brief weather description.


### Example Demo

Here’s an example of how to use the program:
```
    $ python3 weather_app.py
    Enter city name: Salt Lake City
    City: Salt Lake City
    Temperature: 22.83°C / 72.84°F
    Weather: Clear sky
